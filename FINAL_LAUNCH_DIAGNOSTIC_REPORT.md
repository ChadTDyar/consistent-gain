## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES TO FIX BEFORE LAUNCH

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix)

**None found** - No blocking issues detected!

---

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix)

#### 1. Google Analytics Not Configured
**File:** `src/lib/analytics.ts`  
**Issue:** GA4 Measurement ID is still placeholder `G-XXXXXXXXXX`  
**Impact:** Cannot track user behavior, conversions, or traffic  
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Replace line 13 with your actual GA4 ID
export const GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = 'G-YOUR-ACTUAL-ID';
```
**How to get ID:**
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Create property if needed
3. Navigate to Admin ‚Üí Data Streams ‚Üí Web
4. Copy the Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

---

#### 2. Sitemap Has Placeholder Domain
**File:** `public/sitemap.xml`  
**Issue:** All URLs point to `https://yourdomain.com/`  
**Impact:** Search engines won't find your actual site  
**Fix:** Replace all instances of `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain

---

#### 3. Missing Database Policies for User Data Management
**Tables affected:** `profiles`, `chat_messages`, `coach_triggers`  
**Issue:** Users cannot delete their profiles or manage their data  
**Impact:** GDPR compliance risk, poor UX  
**Fix:** Run migration to add missing policies:

```sql
-- Allow users to delete their own profiles (GDPR compliance)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own profile" 
ON profiles FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to edit/delete their chat messages
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own messages" 
ON chat_messages FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own messages" 
ON chat_messages FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to manage coach trigger settings
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own triggers" 
ON coach_triggers FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own triggers" 
ON coach_triggers FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

---

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Fix)

#### 4. React Router Deprecation Warnings
**Issue:** Console shows warnings about v7 future flags  
**Impact:** None currently, but will need update for React Router v7  
**Fix:** Add future flags to `<BrowserRouter>` when ready to migrate

---

#### 5. Stripe Payment Data in Profiles Table
**Level:** Info (not critical)  
**Issue:** Security scan notes payment data could be better isolated  
**Current status:** Protected by RLS, acceptable for launch  
**Future improvement:** Consider separate `subscriptions` table if adding more payment features
